# This program reads a text file that contains a set of integers
# The odd and even integers would be extracted from the main text file inputs and transfer them into separate text files in categorization

# open the numbers.txt file in write mode

# open the numbers.txt file in read mode

# open the even.txt file in write mode and write even numbers to it

# open the odd.txt file in write mode and write odd numbers to it

# print a goodbye message and terminate the program
